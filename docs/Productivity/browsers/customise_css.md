# Customise CSS on any webpage
You can inject and overwrite the css of any website using the chrome extensions [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe) 
or [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne).
The first one had some privacy issues in the past, so it is advised to use Stylus.

You can write your own css or you can make use of the marketplace [userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/).

In the next section some handy userstyles will be mentioned.

## Pepper grid mode
Since [Pepper](https://nl.pepper.com) does not support grid mode anymore, it makes going over the deals a lot harder.
In order to bring it the back, the following userstyle can be used: [Pepper Grid Mode](https://userstyles.org/styles/191088/pepper-grid-mode).

In case the userstyles site loads slow, here is the css code:

??? abstract "Pepper Grid Mode code"
    ```css
    --8<-- "./docs/Productivity/browsers/assets/pepperGridMode.css"
    ```
